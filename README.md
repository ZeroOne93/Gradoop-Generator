# Gradoop-Generator
This code was implemented to test the graph frame work Gradoop on graphs in a tree like structure.<br />

The code can create either logical graphs or graph collection in a two different structures: <br />
1- Single level tree structure where there is a root vertex that is connected to the rest of nodes, where the edges are directed as root==>rest of vertices. <br />
2- Multi-level tree structure, where there are many levels in the tree. <br />
3- Multi-level logical graphs, where each graph can contain N-innerGraphs. so it still a logical graph not a graph collection. <br />
