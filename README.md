# Gradoop-Generator
This code was implemented to generate logical graphs and graph collections in a tree structure for the framework Gradoop.<br />

Either a logical graph or graph collections could be created in different structures: <br />
1- Single level tree structure where there is a root vertex that is connected to the rest of vertices, where the edges are directed from root vertex to the rest of vertices. <br />
2- Multi-level tree structure, where there are many levels in the tree. <br />
3- Multi-level logical graphs, where each graph can contain N-innerGraphs. so it still a logical graph not a graph collection. <br />
